# Day 1
- [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) is a systems programming like C and C++.
- It tries to find the balance between speed, safety, concurrency, and portability.
- Unlike Python and C++, Rust does not have functions for garbage collection. Instead it uses a concept called ownership and borrowing.
- Package manager is caller Cargo.
- Applications that are designed around command line, web assembly, networking, and embedded programming are ideal for Rust.
- To install you can use rustup (recommended) or use conda to create an environment with Rust and other dependencies installed.
